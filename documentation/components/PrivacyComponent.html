    require all recipients to protect all personal information that they
    process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data
    protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be
    provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate
    safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and
    further details can be provided upon request.&lt;/p&gt;
